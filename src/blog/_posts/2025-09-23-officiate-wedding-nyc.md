title: How to Officiate a Wedding in New York City
---

Last week I emceed my friends' wedding as a [one-day marriage officiant](https://www.cityclerk.nyc.gov/content/one-day-marriage-officiant-license). Here's a condensed, plain-English outline of exactly what needs to happen for that.

1. **The couple gets a marriage license.** They go [here](https://projectcupid.cityofnewyork.us/app/cupidceremony#/display/5f21c6447d42630218ccbccb) and choose "Marriage License". Either in-person or virtual will work. The virtual flow still requires an in-person appointment anyway. The license will be valid for only 60 days, so the appointment should be scheduled to occur <60 days before the wedding. The next available appointment slot may be a month or more from today, so plan accordingly.
1. **The officiant gets an officiant license.** They print and complete the [officiant application](https://www.cityclerk.nyc.gov/assets/cityclerk/downloads/pdf/Application_FINAL_4-11_ONEDAYMARRIAGEOFFICIANTLICENSE.pdf), which requires the marriage license number from the previous step[^wedding]. The officiant goes [here](https://projectcupid.cityofnewyork.us/app/cupidceremony#/display/5f21c6447d42630218ccbccb) and chooses "Marriage Officiant" to schedule an appointment. They just need to be 18 years old&mdash;no exams or fake churches.
1. **At the wedding, everyone signs the officiant license.** That's two spouses, the witness(es), and the officiant. The license has space for two witnesses, but only one is legally required. Any adult guest can be a witness.
1. **The officiant exchanges both licenses for a marriage certificate.** They go [here](https://projectcupid.cityofnewyork.us/app/cupidceremony#/display/5f21c6447d42630218ccbccb) and schedule a "Record Room" appointment[^record] at the same physical office as in step 1. This must take place within 5 days of the wedding.

These instructions assume that you don't mind talking to city employees face-to-face. Alternatively you can fill out the paper forms and money orders by yourself, send them back and forth via snail mail, and cross your fingers.

[^wedding]: If the couple just wants a city hall marriage without any kind of wedding ceremony, this is the wrong guide. Stop reading and try the "Marriage Ceremony" option [here](https://projectcupid.cityofnewyork.us/app/cupidceremony#/display/5f21c6447d42630218ccbccb). Good luck!
[^record]: Shout out to [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/WedditNYC/comments/1l1xned/comment/mvplmz5/). This same-day method works but is totally undocumented by the city.
