I needed to connect a Linux client to an [L2TP/IPsec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layer_2_Tunneling_Protocol#L2TP/IPsec) VPN using shared secret (a.k.a. pre-shared key) authentication, but every online guide I could find was inaccurate and/or incomplete. Here's a fully working solution at the time of writing.

The initial 10-minute setup is pretty tedious, but once you've got it working you can throw it all into a `./vpn toggle` script and never worry about it again.

## Walkthrough

Let's say you want to connect to a VPN server with public IP address `68.68.32.79` and shared secret `s0m3Str1ngY0urSysadm1nG1vesY0u`. Your VPN user is `johndoe` with password `j0hn5p455w0rd`.

1. Install Openswan and xl2tpd:

    ```bash
    # Arch Linux
    pacaur -S openswan xl2tpd

    # Ubuntu
    apt-get update && apt-get install openswan xl2tpd
    ```
1. Run `ip route show default` to determine your local IP and default network interface. They should be the 3rd and 5th items in the single line of output. Let's say they're `192.168.1.1` and `eth0`.
1. As root, create these four files, plugging in the six variables we've gotten so far:

    ### /etc/ipsec.conf
    ```bash
    version 2.0

    config setup
      virtual_private=%v4:10.0.0.0/8,%v4:192.168.0.0/16,%v4:172.16.0.0/12
      nat_traversal=yes
      protostack=netkey
      plutoopts="--interface=eth0"

    conn L2TP-PSK
      authby=secret
      pfs=no
      auto=add
      keyingtries=3
      dpddelay=30
      dpdtimeout=120
      dpdaction=clear
      rekey=yes
      ikelifetime=8h
      keylife=1h
      type=transport
      left=%defaultroute
      leftnexthop=%defaultroute
      leftprotoport=17/1701
      right=68.68.32.79
    ```

    ### /etc/ipsec.secrets
    ```bash
    0.0.0.0 68.68.32.79: PSK "s0m3Str1ngY0urSysadm1nG1vesY0u"
    ```

    ### /etc/xl2tpd/xl2tpd.conf
    ```
    [lac vpn-connection]
    lns = 68.68.32.79
    refuse chap = yes
    refuse pap = yes
    require authentication = yes
    name = vpn-server
    ppp debug = yes
    pppoptfile = /etc/ppp/options.l2tpd.client
    length bit = yes
    ```

    ### /etc/ppp/options.l2tpd.client
    ```
    ipcp-accept-local
    ipcp-accept-remote
    refuse-eap
    require-mschap-v2
    noccp
    noauth
    idle 1800
    mtu 1410
    mru 1410
    defaultroute
    usepeerdns
    debug
    connect-delay 5000
    name johndoe
    password j0hn5p455w0rd
    ```
1. Start Openswan and xl2tpd. These three commands, along with all other commands in the remainder of this walkthrough, should be run as root:

    ```bash
    ipsec setup --start
    xl2tpd -D &
    ipsec auto --up L2TP-PSK
    ```
1. Connect to the VPN:

    ```bash
    echo 'c vpn-connection' > /var/run/xl2tpd/l2tp-control
    ```
1. Determine the name of the PPP network interface by running `ip address` and looking for the entry containing `ppp`. Let's say it's called `ppp0`. Now look inside its entry for the word "peer" and the local IP that immediately follows it. Let's say the peer IP is `10.1.14.252`. This is the VPN server's local IP.
1. Add a rule to route subnet traffic through the VPN. `10.0.0.0/8` is [CIDR notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing#CIDR_notation) for the range of local IPs assigned inside your remote network. It doesn't need to be exact. For example, you can use `10.0.0.0/8` to specify that all IPs of the form `10.*.*.*` belong to the VPN even if you suspect that your remote network only assigns IPs of the form `10.1.10.*` and `10.1.14.*`.

    ```bash
    ip route add 10.0.0.0/8 via 10.1.14.252 dev ppp0
    ```
    You can test the new rule by pinging or SSHing the local IP of another machine inside the VPN. If that's all you need, you can stop here.
1. Remember the variables we found in step 2? Use them here to route _all_ internet traffic (not just subnet traffic) through the VPN:

    ```bash
    ip route add 68.68.32.79 via 192.168.1.1 dev eth0
    ip route delete default via 192.168.1.1 dev eth0
    ip route add default via 10.1.14.252 dev ppp0
    ```

Done! You can now open your web browser and access VPN-only resources. To disconnect:

1. Undo the routing rules:

    ```bash
    ip route delete default via 10.1.14.252 dev ppp0
    ip route add default via 192.168.1.1 dev eth0
    ip route delete 68.68.32.79 via 192.168.1.1 dev eth0
    ```
1. Kill the VPN connection, xl2tpd, and Openswan:

    ```bash
    echo 'd vpn-connection' > /var/run/xl2tpd/l2tp-control
    ipsec auto --down L2TP-PSK
    killall xl2tpd
    ipsec setup --stop
    ```

## Caveats

I don't recommend switching from Ethernet to Wi-Fi or vice versa while connected to the VPN since that will change the default network interface (`eth0` in our example) and possibly leave your routing table in a weird state until reboot.

These instructions assume that you regularly use only one L2TP/IPsec VPN. It's straightforward to simply add a new section to the `.conf` files for each additional VPN, but the script below doesn't support that use case out of the box.

I've only tested this on Arch Linux. Let me know if your distro needs any tweaks!

## Script

Once you've successfully executed the steps above by hand, you can automate them all using a script like the one below. I normally run it as `sudo ./vpn toggle`.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
#
# Enables or disables a client connection to an L2TP/IPsec VPN. Usage: save
# this file as `vpn`, `chmod +x` it, and run `./vpn [up/down/toggle]` as root.
# Requires openswan and xl2tpd packages. Tested on Arch Linux.
