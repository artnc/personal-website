title: How to Connect to an L2TP/IPsec VPN from Linux
---

I needed to connect a Linux client to an [L2TP/IPsec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layer_2_Tunneling_Protocol#L2TP/IPsec) VPN using shared secret (a.k.a. pre-shared key) authentication, but every online guide I could find was inaccurate and/or incomplete. Here's a fully working solution at the time of writing.

The initial 10-minute setup is pretty tedious, but once you've got it working you can throw it all into a script and never worry about it again.

> Update 2021-03-21: A less-than-ideal but much easier fix is to build xl2tpd from source with one problematic line [commented out](https://github.com/xelerance/xl2tpd/issues/136#issuecomment-365761037) and save `: PSK "sh4r3ds3cr3t"` to `/etc/ipsec.secrets`. This allows the use of Libreswan and NetworkManager, although on Arch Linux I also had to `sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/ipsec/nss` since that directory wasn't created during Libreswan installation (?!)

## Walkthrough

Let's say you want to connect to a VPN server with public IP address `68.68.32.79` and shared secret `sh4r3ds3cr3t`. Your user account on the VPN server is `johndoe` with password `j0hn5p455w0rd`.

1. Install [Openswan](https://www.openswan.org/) for IPsec and [xl2tpd](https://github.com/xelerance/xl2tpd) for L2TP:

   ```bash
   # Arch Linux
   pacaur -S openswan xl2tpd

   # Ubuntu
   apt-get update && apt-get install openswan xl2tpd
   ```

1. Run `ip route show default` to determine your local IP and default network interface. They should be the 3rd and 5th items in the single line of output. Let's say they're `192.168.1.1` and `eth0`.

1. As root, create these four files, plugging in the six variables we've gotten so far:

   ### /etc/ipsec.conf

   ```text
   version 2.0

   config setup
     virtual_private=%v4:10.0.0.0/8,%v4:192.168.0.0/16,%v4:172.16.0.0/12
     nat_traversal=yes
     protostack=netkey
     plutoopts="--interface=eth0"

   conn L2TP-PSK
     authby=secret
     pfs=no
     auto=add
     keyingtries=3
     dpddelay=30
     dpdtimeout=120
     dpdaction=clear
     rekey=yes
     ikelifetime=8h
     keylife=1h
     type=transport
     left=%defaultroute
     leftnexthop=%defaultroute
     leftprotoport=17/1701
     right=68.68.32.79
   ```

   ### /etc/ipsec.secrets

   ```text
   0.0.0.0 68.68.32.79: PSK "sh4r3ds3cr3t"
   ```

   ### /etc/xl2tpd/xl2tpd.conf

   ```
   [lac vpn-connection]
   lns = 68.68.32.79
   refuse chap = yes
   refuse pap = yes
   require authentication = yes
   name = vpn-server
   ppp debug = yes
   pppoptfile = /etc/ppp/options.l2tpd.client
   length bit = yes
   ```

   ### /etc/ppp/options.l2tpd.client

   ```
   ipcp-accept-local
   ipcp-accept-remote
   refuse-eap
   require-mschap-v2
   noccp
   noauth
   idle 1800
   mtu 1410
   mru 1410
   defaultroute
   usepeerdns
   debug
   connect-delay 5000
   name johndoe
   password j0hn5p455w0rd
   ```

1. Start Openswan and xl2tpd. These three commands, along with all other commands in the remainder of this walkthrough, should be run as root:

   ```bash
   ipsec setup --start
   xl2tpd -D &
   ipsec auto --up L2TP-PSK
   ```

1. Connect to the VPN:

   ```bash
   echo 'c vpn-connection' > /var/run/xl2tpd/l2tp-control
   ```

1. Determine the name of the [PPP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point-to-Point_Protocol) network interface by running `ip address` and looking for the entry containing `ppp`. Let's say it's called `ppp0`. Now look inside its entry for the word "peer" and the local IP that immediately follows it. Let's say the peer IP is `10.1.14.252`. This is the VPN server's local IP.

1. Add a rule to route subnet traffic through the VPN. `10.0.0.0/8` is [CIDR notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing#CIDR_notation) for the range of local IPs assigned inside your remote network. It doesn't need to be exact. For example, you can use `10.0.0.0/8` to specify that all IPs of the form `10.*.*.*` belong to the VPN even if you suspect that your remote network only assigns IPs of the form `10.1.10.*` and `10.1.14.*`.

   ```bash
   ip route add 10.0.0.0/8 via 10.1.14.252 dev ppp0
   ```

   You can test the new rule by pinging or SSHing the local IP of another machine inside the VPN. If that's all you need, you can stop here.

1. Remember the variables we found in step 2? Use them here to route _all_ internet traffic (not just subnet traffic) through the VPN:

   ```bash
   ip route add 68.68.32.79 via 192.168.1.1 dev eth0
   ip route delete default via 192.168.1.1 dev eth0
   ip route add default via 10.1.14.252 dev ppp0
   ```

Done! You can now open your web browser and access VPN-only resources. To disconnect:

1. Undo the routing rules:

   ```bash
   ip route delete default via 10.1.14.252 dev ppp0
   ip route add default via 192.168.1.1 dev eth0
   ip route delete 68.68.32.79 via 192.168.1.1 dev eth0
   ```

1. Kill the VPN connection, xl2tpd, and Openswan:

   ```bash
   echo 'd vpn-connection' > /var/run/xl2tpd/l2tp-control
   ipsec auto --down L2TP-PSK
   killall xl2tpd
   ipsec setup --stop
   ```

## Caveats

I don't recommend switching from Ethernet to Wi-Fi or vice versa while connected to the VPN since that will change the default network interface (`eth0` in our example) and possibly leave your routing table in a weird state until reboot.

These instructions assume that you regularly use only one L2TP/IPsec VPN. It's straightforward to simply add a new section to the `.conf` files for each additional VPN, but the script below doesn't support that use case out of the box.

I've only tested this on Arch Linux. Let me know if your distro needs any tweaks!

## Script

Once you've successfully executed the steps above by hand, you can automate them all using a script like the one below. I normally run it as `sudo ./vpn toggle`.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
#
# Enables or disables a client connection to an L2TP/IPsec VPN. Usage: save
# this file as `vpn`, `chmod +x` it, and run `./vpn [up/down/toggle]` as root.
# Requires openswan and xl2tpd packages. Tested on Arch Linux.
