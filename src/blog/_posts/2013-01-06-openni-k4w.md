title: OpenNI with Kinect for Windows
---

Hopefully this will save some poor soul from many more hours of frustration. Please note that this is for Kinect for Windows (K4W), not the regular Xbox Kinect.

1. Remove whatever versions of OpenNI and SensorKinect you may already have on your computer.
1. Install the [patched version](http://pointclouds.org/downloads/windows.html) of OpenNI 1.5.4 from PCL.
1. Install the [latest version](https://github.com/avin2/SensorKinect/tree/unstable/Bin) of SensorKinect from avin2.
1. Install the latest [unstable version](http://www.openni.org/openni-sdk/) of OpenNI 2.

This method worked today on my 64-bit Windows 7 laptop (official Kinect SDK not installed). No guarantees that it'll work for much longer...
