title: Raytracing, Morphing, and OpenGL
---

The highest-numbered undergrad CS elective offered at UVa is [CS 4810](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~gfx/Courses/2012/IntroGraphics/schedule.html), Intro to Computer Graphics. Its transparent grading policy, rewarding results, and unforgivingly mathematical nature made it a fun challenge and easily the most worthwhile class I've ever taken.

60% of the final grade was determined by three C++ programming assignments, each accompanied by an extra-credit [art contest](http://people.virginia.edu/~sj6re/Fall2012CS4810.html) that required entries to be generated using the programs themselves. My winning submissions:
