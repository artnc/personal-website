Hi! I'm a software engineer at [Duolingo](http://www.duolingo.com/), where I wrote the flagship apps for web and Windows, the [DET](https://englishtest.duolingo.com/) web app, and the API backend. Now I lead Android and web development. Previously I graduated from the University of Virginia at 19 with majors in CS and math. More in [résumé](/files/ArtChaidarun-WebResume.pdf).

I spend my spare time arranging [guitar](/musescore-tab), recording [piano](https://soundcloud.com/artnc), performing [tuba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Winds_Symphonic_Band), and [blogging](/blog) about tech and music. Currently in Pittsburgh.
