Hi! I'm a software engineer at [Duolingo](http://www.duolingo.com/), where I wrote the flagship apps for web and Windows, the [DET](https://englishtest.duolingo.com/) web app, and the API backend. I've also led our [Android](https://blog.duolingo.com/migrating-duolingos-android-app-to-100-kotlin/), [internal tooling](https://blog.duolingo.com/open-sourcing-metasearch-our-one-tool-to-search-them-all/), and [open source](https://github.com/duolingo/) efforts. Previously I worked at [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) and graduated from [UVA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Virginia) at 19 with majors in CS and math. More in [résumé](/files/ArtChaidarun-WebResume.pdf).

I spend my spare time arranging [guitar](/musescore-tab), recording [piano](https://soundcloud.com/artnc), performing [tuba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Winds_Symphonic_Band), bouldering, reading, doing the NYT crossword, and [blogging](/blog) about tech and music.
