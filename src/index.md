Hello! I'm a software engineer at [Duolingo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duolingo), where I've led development of the flagship apps for [Android](https://blog.duolingo.com/migrating-duolingos-android-app-to-100-kotlin/), [web](https://www.duolingo.com/), and [Windows](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9wzdncrcv5xn), the API backend, the [DET](https://englishtest.duolingo.com/) app, [internal tooling](https://blog.duolingo.com/open-sourcing-metasearch-our-one-tool-to-search-them-all/), [open source](https://github.com/duolingo/), the [company blog](https://blog.duolingo.com/), and [more](/img/pit-wifi.png). I also worked at [OpenAI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI) and graduated from [UVA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Virginia) at 19 with majors in CS and math. See [résumé](/resume).

I spend my spare time on [guitar](/musescore-tab), [tuba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Winds_Symphonic_Band), [piano](https://soundcloud.com/artnc), volleyball, bouldering, [blogging](/blog), [crosswords](https://www.crosswordtournament.com/2023/standings/rank.htm), [trivia](https://learnedleague.com/profiles.php?91076), [languages](https://www.duolingo.com/profile/artnc), [travel](/camino-de-santiago), knitting, and [my dog](/img/snorlax.jpg).
