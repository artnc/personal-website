I spend my free time on [guitalele](/guitalele), [guitar](/musescore-tab), [piano](https://soundcloud.com/artnc), volleyball, bouldering, [blogging](/blog), [trivia](https://learnedleague.com/profiles.php?91076), [crosswords](https://www.crosswordtournament.com/2023/standings/rank.htm), [languages](https://www.duolingo.com/profile/artnc), [reading](/ten-years-of-logging-my-life#media-chart), knitting, and [my dog](/img/snorlax.jpg).
