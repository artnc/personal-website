Hello! I'm a software engineer and early employee at [Duolingo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duolingo), where I've led development of the Android app, the website, and [a lot more](/projects#duolingo). I also worked at [OpenAI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI) and graduated from [UVA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Virginia) at 19 with majors in CS and math. See [résumé](/resume).

I spend my free time on [guitar](/musescore-tab), [tuba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Winds_Symphonic_Band), volleyball, [blogging](/blog), [trivia](https://learnedleague.com/profiles.php?91076), [crosswords](https://www.crosswordtournament.com/2023/standings/rank.htm), [languages](https://www.duolingo.com/profile/artnc), [reading](/ten-years-of-logging-my-life#media-chart), and [my dog](/img/snorlax.jpg). Hobbies on hiatus include bouldering, [hiking](/camino-de-santiago), [piano](https://soundcloud.com/artnc), [sousaphone](/img/sousaphone.jpg), and clarinet. Currently in Pittsburgh, PA.
